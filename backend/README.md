<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The School API is a RESTful web service that provides access to information about students, teachers, courses, and other related entities in a school system. The API is designed to be used by various clients such as mobile apps, web applications, and other third-party integrations.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Authentication and authorization: The API allows users to create accounts, log in, and access resources based on their roles and permissions.</li>
    <li>Student information: The API provides information about students such as their names, email addresses, and grades.</li>
    <li>Teacher information: The API provides information about teachers such as their names, email addresses, and courses they teach.</li>
    <li>Course information: The API provides information about courses such as the course name, description, and teacher assigned to the course.</li>
    <li>Enrollment management: The API allows students to enroll in courses and view their enrollment status.</li>
    <li>Grade management: The API allows teachers to submit grades for students enrolled in their courses.</li>
    <li>Data filtering and pagination: The API allows users to filter and paginate data to improve performance and reduce network overhead.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technology Stack</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Node.js: A server-side JavaScript runtime environment that allows for asynchronous I/O and event-driven programming.</li>
    <li>Express.js: A minimalist web framework for Node.js that provides a set of features for building web applications and APIs.</li>
    <li>MongoDB: A NoSQL document-oriented database that allows for flexible and scalable data storage.</li>
    <li>Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB that provides a higher level of abstraction for data manipulation.</li>
    <li>JSON Web Tokens (JWT): A standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>The School API follows a layered architecture pattern to separate concerns and improve maintainability. The layers are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Presentation layer: This layer is responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses. It uses Express.js to define routes and middleware for authentication and authorization.</li>
    <li>Business logic layer: This layer contains the business rules and processes of the API. It uses Mongoose to interact with the database and perform CRUD operations on the entities.</li>
    <li>Data access layer: This layer is responsible for accessing the database and providing a way to store and retrieve data. It uses MongoDB to store the data in a document-oriented way.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The School API is a scalable and flexible solution for managing student, teacher, and course information in a school system. It provides a set of features for users to interact with the data and is built using a modern technology stack and a layered architecture pattern.</p>
