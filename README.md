School API Project
Overview
The School API is a RESTful web service that provides access to information about students, teachers, courses, and other related entities in a school system. The API is designed to be used by various clients such as mobile apps, web applications, and other third-party integrations.

<>Features<>
The School API provides the following features:

Authentication and authorization: The API allows users to create accounts, log in, and access resources based on their roles and permissions.
Student information: The API provides information about students such as their names, email addresses, and grades.
Teacher information: The API provides information about teachers such as their names, email addresses, and courses they teach.
Course information: The API provides information about courses such as the course name, description, and teacher assigned to the course.
Enrollment management: The API allows students to enroll in courses and view their enrollment status.
Grade management: The API allows teachers to submit grades for students enrolled in their courses.
Data filtering and pagination: The API allows users to filter and paginate data to improve performance and reduce network overhead.
Technology Stack
The School API is built using the following technologies:

Node.js: A server-side JavaScript runtime environment that allows for asynchronous I/O and event-driven programming.
Express.js: A minimalist web framework for Node.js that provides a set of features for building web applications and APIs.
MongoDB: A NoSQL document-oriented database that allows for flexible and scalable data storage.
Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB that provides a higher level of abstraction for data manipulation.
JSON Web Tokens (JWT): A standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
Architecture
The School API follows a layered architecture pattern to separate concerns and improve maintainability. The layers are:

Presentation layer: This layer is responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses. It uses Express.js to define routes and middleware for authentication and authorization.
Business logic layer: This layer contains the business rules and processes of the API. It uses Mongoose to interact with the database and perform CRUD operations on the entities.
Data access layer: This layer is responsible for accessing the database and providing a way to store and retrieve data. It uses MongoDB to store the data in a document-oriented way.

Conclusion
The School API is a scalable and flexible solution for managing student, teacher, and course information in a school system. It provides a set of features for users to interact with the data and is built using a modern technology stack and a layered architecture pattern.
